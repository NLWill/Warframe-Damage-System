# Warframe Damage System

This is a project to re-create the complex damage system from the game Warframe. 

Throughout this project, I seek to  simulate the entire system to accurately predict behaviour in prescribed circumstances.

This project also is inspired by the updates (or lack thereof) for the website Overframe.gg, which frequently takes months or years to add a feature from the game. This system provides functionality such as incarnon evolutions which are still not on Overframe (as of 21st Feb 2025), despite being in Warframe since April 2022.
